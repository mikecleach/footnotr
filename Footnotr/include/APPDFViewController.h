/**
 * PDF View controller used for viewing, reading, and navigating PDF
 * documents.
 *
 * Note that certain features will be unavailable unless the APPDFDocument
 * provided in the initializer has been processed using the
 * APPDFProcessor API. You may call the APPDFProcessor API while the
 * file is being viewed in the view controller; in this case, once
 * processing is complete, the view controller will detect this and
 * enable all relevant functionality, updating the display if
 * necessary.
 *
 * Also note that the APPDFViewController requires that the proper
 * UIViewController view state notification methods are called,
 * including the appear/disappear notifications (eg, [UIViewController
 * viewWillAppear:]) and rotation notifications (eg, [UIViewController
 * willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration:]). This is done
 * automatically by the iOS frameworks and the standard
 * UIViewController subclasses (example: UINavigationController, or
 * when using [UIViewController
 * presentModalViewController:animated:]), but if you are embedding
 * the PDF view in a custom view controller -- which will be the case
 * in most applications that have additional UI controls for
 * interacting with the PDF View -- then you will need to pass along
 * these notifications at the appropriate times. These notifications
 * are required in order to ensure that the PDF view creates and
 * releases resources appropriately.
 *
 * Use the APPDFViewDelegate protocol to receive delegate
 * notifications about user actions being performed within this view
 * controller.
